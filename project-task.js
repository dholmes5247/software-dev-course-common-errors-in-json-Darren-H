/*

ACTIONS TAKEN:
1-Removed the BackTicks at the beginning and end- template literal.  
2-added a comma, after checkInDate, commas go between key value Pairs in Object
2.5-added double quotes to the key "name": "Alice Johnson" line
3-changed the undefined data type to Null, can't use undefined
4-removed the comma after parking in the last Array, it wasn't needed
5-Fixed Curly Que Braces that weren't matched up with one another.
6. Removed the Const line as we are just sending data with JSON.
7. Ensured Brackets were matched up properly.
